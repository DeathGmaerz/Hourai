# Self Hosting

?> This is a document about running your own version of the bot. For information
on running your own instance of the bot, see
[Development](development/).

!> Self-hosting is generally ill-advised due to the number of components that
the main bot depends on. Additionally, many of the security benefits of Hourai
arise from the number of servers it operates on. Running Hourai on a limited
number of servers may limit the quality of service provided.
